<color=yellow><b>Patch v1.8</b></color>
Hey Townies! Patch v1.8 introduces a brand new role, the Pacifist, alongside major reworks, balance changes, and bug fixes.

<b>New Role:</b>
• Pacifist – The Pacifist can Rally Town members into starting a Protest. If they correctly guess all living Town members, a Protest begins the next day. If the Pacifist survives the Protest, their team wins the game.

<b>Improvements:</b>
• Added “Sent from Discord” as a keyword
• Socialite has been added, taking over the old Crusader’s kit
• The Cursed Soul faction has been renamed to Wandering Souls
• Dreamweaver UI received technical improvements for easier use
• Casual Queue Lobby now displays the total number of players in queue
• Patch Notes can now be viewed on the login screen

<b>Balance Changes:</b>

• Feelin’ Lucky
– Reveal Role token now has a 50:50 chance between your role and a random other role

• Seer
– Now compares two players’ factions again
– Seer instead learns if the “energy” between them is high or low
– Seers don’t know at first whether high/low means friends or enemies
– Different Seers may see different energies for the same pair

• Berserker
– Starts with a Basic Attack
– Gains Powerful Attack after first successful kill
– Can attack every night except Night 1 (unless in Pandora modes with Necronomicon)
– Now appears Suspicious to Sheriff

• Coroner
– Can Examine every night
– Examined players are marked as Suspects
– At the end of the night, for each Autopsied player, if a Suspect is their killer you will learn them

• Crusader
– Fortify now protects against direct attacks (similar to Bodyguard/Trapper/Trickster)
– Wounds all direct attackers upon saving someone
– If an attacker is already Wounded, they instead take a Basic Attack
– If Crusader visits an already Wounded player, they deal a Basic Attack to them
– Crusaders do not attack players Wounded by other Crusaders

• Illusionist
– Removed Mass Hysteria
– Illusioned teammates no longer bypass Bodyguards/Trappers
– Illusions no longer affect Deputy shots
– Added new abilities:
– Facade (Passive): Choose a role to appear as upon death
– Phantasm (1 use): Make your entire team look innocent for the night (excludes Town Traitors)

• Trapper
– Trap trigger information is now randomized instead of in player order

• Inquisitor
– Cursed Soul can no longer become a Heretic

• Cursed Soul
– Has a 100% chance to swap with non-Town, non-CS targets
– Gains Invincible Defense once the final CS dies

<b>Bug Fixes:</b>
• Fixed Amnesiac not prioritizing Catalyst over non-unique roles
• Fixed Plaguebearer seeing duplicate Smoked messages when visiting a Smokebombed player
• Fixed Starspawn seeing Lookouts twice when Starbounding them
• Fixed Pirate ignoring Grace Period
• Fixed bugs with auto draw detector
• Fixed visual bugs in Dreamweaver UI when adding players to messages
